                    <br> You have arrived in Teyvat — a fantasy world where the seven elements flow and converge. <br>
                    In the distant past, the Archons granted mortals unique elemental abilities. With the help of such
                    powers, <br> people formed a bountiful homeland out of the wilderness. However, 500 years ago, the
                    collapse of an ancient <br> civilization turned the universe upside down... <br> Though the calamity
                    the world suffered has ceased, peace has yet to be restored. <br>

                    A city of freedom that lies in the northeast of Teyvat. <br>
                    From amongst mountains and wide-open plains, carefree breezes carry the scent of dandelions <br> — a
                    gift from the Anemo God, Barbatos — across Cider Lake to Mondstadt, which sits on an <br> island in
                    the middle of the lake. <br>

                    A bountiful harbor that lies in the east of Teyvat. <br>
                    Mountains stand tall and proud alongside the stone forest, that together with the open plains <br>
                    and
                    lively rivers make up Liyue's bountiful landscape, which shows its unique beauty through <br> each
                    of the
                    four seasons. Just how many gifts from the Geo God lie in wait amongst the rocks of Liyue's
                    mountains? <br>

                    The city of scholars located in the west-central part of Teyvat. <br>
                    A fantastical nation of both lush rainforest and barren desert, where countless fruits of wisdom

                    academy city or delve deep into the desert to discover the historical ruins of the red desert, a
                    <br> wealth of valuable knowledge awaits them here. <br>
